# GolangAuth
This repo shows authentication methods which can be useful for many websites for authenticating users via credentials.

Please make sure you have a local MongoDB instance running before attempting to run anything here! A simple auth flow may look something like this

1.User Registers 
2.User Login via credentilas
3.User Logouts via sessionID

/register "register a new user"
/login "authenticates a user"
/logout "destroys current user's session"

Install required dependencies and then run the code by following instructions:

Run code via go build and go run main.go
